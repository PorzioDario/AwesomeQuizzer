This project is a javascript front end application written using React.js 16.8 and Redux.

I created this project as a case study to practice during the learning of React and other related libraries. I'm currently working on a backend project too, using node.js which will be soon published on github too.

This application let users create and manage quizzes or tests on open topics, add questions and relative answers and finally enroll participants which will then do this test and the creator of the test can see the final score.
